____________________________Exercise 1____________________________
Sentential form					-->	a string is a sentential form if it occurs at a step in a valid derivation
parse tree						--> a graph representation of a derivation
ambiguity						--> ambiguity occurs when a sentence in the language of a grammer derives in more than one derivation
left / right recursion			--> left recursion occurs if a nonterminal symbol can derive to a sentential form with itself as the leftmost symbol. Right recursion is the opposite.
recursive-descent parsing		--> parsing with a set of mutually recursive procedures. Each non-terminal has such a procedure. simple and efficient for Backtrack-free grammars
LL(x)							--> a left-to-right leftmost parser with a lookahead of x. Reads the input from left to right and uses leftmost derivation to rewrite it. Parses it top-down with a lookahead of x.
bottom-up parsing				--> parsing from the leaves of a parse tree to the top/root. Creates a leaf node of the tree for a word returned by the scanner and works its way up with other (non)terminals to reach the top / root.
LR(x)							--> a left-to-right rightmost parser with a lookahead of x. Reads the input from left to right and uses rightmost derivation to rewrite it. Parses it top-down with a lookahead of x.

2) Rightmost derivation is the most clean one and does reflect the structure of the sentence in the best way,
because of the continous derivation of the subject. However, leftmost derivation
