____________________________Exercise 1____________________________
Sentential form					-->	a string is a sentential form if it occurs at a step in a valid derivation
parse tree						--> a graph representation of a derivation
ambiguity						--> ambiguity occurs when a sentence in the language of a grammer derives in more than one derivation
left / right recursion			--> left recursion occurs if a nonterminal symbol can derive to a sentential form with itself as the leftmost symbol. Right recursion is the opposite.
recursive-descent parsing		--> parsing with a set of mutually recursive procedures. Each non-terminal has such a procedure. simple and efficient for Backtrack-free grammars
LL(x)							--> a left-to-right leftmost parser with a lookahead of x. Reads the input from left to right and uses leftmost derivation to rewrite it. Parses it top-down with a lookahead of x.
bottom-up parsing				--> parsing from the leaves of a parse tree to the top/root. Creates a leaf node of the tree for a word returned by the scanner and works its way up with other (non)terminals to reach the top / root.
LR(x)							--> a left-to-right rightmost parser with a lookahead of x. Reads the input from left to right and uses rightmost derivation to rewrite it. Parses it top-down with a lookahead of x.

2) Rightmost derivation is the most clean one and does reflect the structure of the sentence in the best way,
because of the continous derivation of the subject. However, leftmost derivation

Showing grammar satisfies LL(1) condition:

	 	a	b	c	eof	e
FIRST	a	b	c 	eof	e

		Production		FIRST set	FIRST+ set

This satisfies the LL(1) condition!



____________________________Exercise 7____________________________
The pars tree doesn't look alike one of our parse trees, because we did not follow the leftmost derivation exactly.
The program works good. :)



____________________________Exercise 9____________________________
Output:
(sentence (subject (modifier all) (subject (modifier smart) (subject (modifier undergraduate) (subject students)))) love (object (modifier all) (object compilers)) .)
line 1:18 no viable alternative at input 'love'
(sentence (subject (modifier all) (subject students)) love (object love) .)

line 1 is the viable input. It shows the parse tree in another way.
line 2 is the error for the unviable input. Error says where it goes wrong.
line 3 is the parse tree which it made



____________________________Exercise 11____________________________
1) Not only the entry/exit methods are specified in two alternatives, also the parameters are specified in those alternatives.
Instead of a SubjectContext we now have a ModSubjectContext and a SimpleSubjectContext which is imported from the parser.
These classes extend the SubjectContext class and therefore inherit everything from it. However, their fields and
methods are following the rule alternative they are for. (fields modifier subject vs noun, methods which use those fields).

2) It corresponds more with the rightmost parse tree now, because the assoc now results in a rightmost derivation of the modifiers.
If you leave the assoc it will go back to a leftmost parse tree.
