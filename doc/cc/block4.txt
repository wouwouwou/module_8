____________________________Exercise 1____________________________
AST (especially difference with parse tree)			Abstract Syntax Tree. Tree structured IR (intermediate representation).
													Parse tree is a concrete representation of the input, the AST is an abstract represenation.
													AST omits most nodes for nonterminal symbols.
DAG													Directed Acyclic Graphs. An AST with sharing, where nodes can have multiple parents. Therefore
													a DAG can be more compact than an AST.
basic block											The simplest unit of control flow in a program; a maximal length sequence of
													straightline, or branch-free code.
CFG (two meanings)									Context Free Grammar. For a language L, its CFG defines the sets of strings of symbols
													that are valid sentences in L.
													Control Flow Graph. A directed graph where each node is a basic block and each edge is
													a transition from block i to block j.
dependence graph									Models the definition and the use of values / variables in a code fragment.
call graph											representation of the runtime transfers of control between procedures. Each procedure has a node,
													each edge is a distinct procedure call site.
SSA													Statig Single-Assignment form. An IR which contains information about both the flow of control
													and the flow of data values in the program.
symbol table										The symbol table localizes information derived from potentially distant parts of the source code.
													It is way easier to get your information from a table than computing the data every time.

2)
1, 2, 3 can be combined because they have max 1 outgoing and max 1 incoming edges. 5 can not, because it is the only one node there.

3)
1, 2 and 3 can be reordered because there is no dependency between them


____________________________Exercise 3____________________________
1)
See cc3-data.pdf and cc3-flow.pdf

2)
Lines 1, 2 and 3 can be combined into a basic block.

3)
Lines 1, 2 and 3 can be reordered as there is no dependency between them.
6 and 9 can be reordered according to the data flow, but because of the nature
of this code reordering those statements would change the behaviour.
